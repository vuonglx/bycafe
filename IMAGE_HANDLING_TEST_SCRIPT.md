# ByCafe Image Handling Test Script

This test script focuses on verifying the robust image handling system implemented for product images throughout the ByCafe e-commerce application.

## Test Environment Setup

Before running tests, ensure the following:

1. All image files are properly placed in the `public/images` directory
2. The application is running in development mode (`npm start`)
3. Browser developer tools are open to monitor network and console logs

## 1. ProductCard Component Image Tests

### 1.1 Primary Image Loading Test

**Objective**: Verify that product images load correctly in ProductCard components.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to the Product Catalog page
2. Observe all product cards displayed in the grid
3. Verify that each product card displays its image
4. Check browser console for any image loading errors

**Expected Result**: All product cards should display their images correctly with no console errors.

### 1.2 Image Error Handling Test

**Objective**: Verify that the error handling system works when images fail to load.

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily rename or move an image file from the `public/images` directory
2. Navigate to the Product Catalog page
3. Observe the product card that should display the missing image
4. Check that the error styling is applied (reduced opacity, grayscale filter)

**Expected Result**: The product card should display the error state styling instead of showing a broken image icon.

## 2. ProductDetailPage Image Tests

### 2.1 Main Product Image Test

**Objective**: Verify that the main product image loads correctly on the Product Detail page.

**Steps**:
1. Click on any product card to navigate to its detail page
2. Observe the main product image
3. Check browser console for any image loading errors

**Expected Result**: The main product image should load and display correctly with no console errors.

### 2.2 Image Gallery Navigation Test

**Objective**: Verify that all images in the product gallery load correctly and can be navigated.

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to a product detail page
2. Click on each thumbnail in the image gallery
3. Verify that the main image changes to the selected thumbnail
4. Check browser console for any image loading errors

**Expected Result**: All thumbnail images should load correctly, and clicking each should update the main image.

### 2.3 Main Image Error Handling Test

**Objective**: Verify that the error handling system works for the main product image.

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily rename or move a product's main image file from the `public/images` directory
2. Navigate to that product's detail page
3. Observe the main product image
4. Check that the error styling is applied (reduced opacity, grayscale filter)

**Expected Result**: The main image should display with error styling instead of showing a broken image icon.

### 2.4 Thumbnail Error Handling Test

**Objective**: Verify that the error handling system works for thumbnail images.

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily rename or move a product's thumbnail image file from the `public/images` directory
2. Navigate to that product's detail page
3. Observe the thumbnail images
4. Check that the error styling is applied to the affected thumbnail

**Expected Result**: The affected thumbnail should display with error styling instead of showing a broken image icon.

### 2.5 Related Products Image Error Handling Test

**Objective**: Verify that the error handling system works for related product images.

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily rename or move a related product's image file from the `public/images` directory
2. Navigate to a product detail page that shows this related product
3. Observe the related product images
4. Check that the error styling is applied to the affected related product image

**Expected Result**: The affected related product should display with error styling instead of showing a broken image icon.

## 3. Network Condition Tests

### 3.1 Slow Network Test

**Objective**: Verify image loading behavior under slow network conditions.

**Steps**:
1. Use browser developer tools to simulate a slow network connection (3G or slower)
2. Navigate to the Product Catalog page and then to a Product Detail page
3. Observe image loading behavior

**Expected Result**: Images should load progressively, and any failed images should trigger the error handling system.

### 3.2 Offline Mode Test

**Objective**: Verify error handling behavior when network is unavailable.

**Steps**:
1. Load the application and navigate to the Product Catalog page
2. Use browser developer tools to switch to offline mode
3. Refresh the page or navigate to a different page
4. Observe image loading behavior

**Expected Result**: The error handling system should activate for images that cannot be loaded from cache.

## 4. Edge Case Tests

### 4.1 Invalid Image Path Test

**Objective**: Verify error handling behavior with invalid image paths.

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily edit a product's image path in the mock data to point to a non-existent file
2. Navigate to the page containing this product
3. Observe image loading behavior
4. Check that the error styling is applied

**Expected Result**: The error handling system should activate and apply the appropriate styling.

### 4.2 Browser Console Verification

**Objective**: Verify that image loading errors are properly logged in the console.

**Steps**:
1. Open browser developer tools and navigate to the Console tab
2. Intentionally cause image loading failures using methods from previous tests
3. Observe console output for image loading errors

**Expected Result**: Image loading errors should be logged in the console with relevant information.

## Test Results Documentation

For each test, document:

1. Test ID and name
2. Date tested
3. Pass/Fail status
4. Actual behavior observed
5. Screenshots of any issues
6. Notes or additional observations

## Regression Testing

After any changes to the image handling system, re-run these tests to ensure that the error handling functionality continues to work as expected.
